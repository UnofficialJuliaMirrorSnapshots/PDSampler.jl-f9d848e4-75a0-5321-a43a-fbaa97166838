# Adding a feature

#### Adding a new feature to the code

If you wish to add a feature, please follow the following few steps:

* Keep it concise (so that the relevant PR is readable)
* Write a test for it and make sure it passes
* Document it at least briefly
* Ideally write an executable example for it

Please try to follow the conventions around the code to make code review simpler to manage.

#### Replacing a part of the code

If you want to generalise / modify / fix a part of the code, please make sure you follow similar steps:

* Make sure your modifications pass the tests or modify the relevant tests, add tests if the rewrite is more general
* Make sure the fix is documented appropriately (both in )
